# EEE4114F_DTMFDecoder
A project for our Digitial Signals Processing course, EEE4114F at the University of Cape Town.

For this project we have designed a DTMF (Dual-Tone Multifrequency) decoder. DTMF signalling is employed worldwide with push-button telephone sets and has served as a high-speed alternative to rotary telephone sets used predominately in the 1900s. Apart from the application mentioned above, DTMF signalling has also found itself in various other real-world applications such as e-mail, telephone banking and ATM machines. A DTMF signal is represented by the sum of two frequencies, which have been exclusively predetermined. These dual frequency combinations each represent a digit or a symbol on a telephone keypad [1]. 

Finally, the purpose of a DTMF decoder and thus the main goal of this project was to convert a recording of “touch-tones” from a real telephone into a corresponding set of digits or symbols.

This project was chosen as a way for us to further our understanding of filter design in the field of digital signals processing. Furthermore, this project exposes us to the various other real-world applications for filter design, outside what we have already done for the labs throughout the course.


We looked at a range of popular software tools used in the digital signals processing field and concluded that MATLAB would be best suited for the implementation of our project. The version of MATLAB used was 9.10.0,1577079.
